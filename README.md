# Guess the Song
Guess the Song is an iOS game where players attempt to answer as much about a given song as they can, as fast as they can! The game features three modes: Campaigns, Singleplayer and Multiplayer.

# Song Guessing
When guessing songs, a random song will begin to play as a 45 second timer counts down in the background. Within this time, players must guess the title of the song, the main artist who sings it, as well as the name of the album it belongs to. The faster the answer, the more points a player gets. 

# Campaigns
Players who would like to exercise their knowledge of one particular artist’s music can do so in campaigns! There are 10 campaigns, each featuring their own artist with 10 songs.

# Singleplayer
In singleplayer, the game begins with a table of 9 squares. One square will have a hidden vinyl disc. If a player flips a box and the box does not contain a vinyl, they have to guess a song and then continue searching. Once they find the square with the vinyl, they need to answer correctly in order to obtain it. Once they do, the squares reset and they search for another crown. The game ends once a player obtains 5 crowns or loses all of their lives (they have 6). If a player successfully obtains all 5 crowns, their accumulated score is doubled.

# Multiplayer
The multiplayer mode shares the same rules as the singleplayer mode, although now two players compete for a higher score! Players alternate turns searching for the square with a vinyl, and this will be unaffected by whether a player gets an answer right or wrong. The game ends once a player obtains all five vinyls, or when a player loses all of their lives. Upon ending, the victorious player’s score is doubled.

# Scoring System
After a player enters an answer, if they answer correctly, they will obtain a number of points depending on the amount of time left on the clock.

1. 41 to 45 seconds - 8 points
2. 36 to 40 seconds - 7 points
3. 31 to 35 seconds - 6 points
4. 26 to 30 seconds - 5 points
5. 21 to 25 seconds - 4 points
6. 16 to 20 seconds - 3 points
7. 11 to 15 seconds - 2 points
8. 1 to 10 seconds - 1 point

# Music
The game includes over 150 songs across 3 different genres: rap/hip-hop, pop and 70s.

# Usage
You can open guess-the-song.xcodeproj in Xcode and build the app to try it on Simulator!
